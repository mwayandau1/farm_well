# üåæ AI-Powered Mobile Farming Application
Welcome to the AI-Powered Mobile Farming Application! This application is designed to help farmers predict crop and plant diseases, provide precautions and recommended treatments, and offer educational content. Additionally, it enables farmers to interact with each other on the platform.

## ‚ú® Features
- Disease Prediction: Utilize AI to predict potential crop and plant diseases based on images and other inputs.
- Precautions and Treatments: Receive expert recommendations for disease prevention and treatment.
- Educational Content: Access a library of educational resources to learn about best farming practices, crop management, and more.
- Community Interaction: Connect and interact with other farmers, share experiences, and ask for advice within the community.
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Tensorflow: Python framework for training the model
- Vision Transformer: Model architecture in which the dataset was trained on
- Flutter: A UI toolkit for crafting natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- Firebase: A platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications.
- Firebase Auth: Secure authentication system that provides a way to authenticate users of the application.
- Firebase Firestore: NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data for client- and server-side development.
- Firebase Storage: Store and serve user-generated content, such as images and videos.
