        "A natural way to kill spider mites on your plants is to mix one part rubbing alcohol with one part water, then spray the leaves. The alcohol will kill the mites without harming the plants. Another natural solution to get rid of these tiny pests is to use liquid dish soap.",
    "Tomato___Target___Spot":
        "Target spot tomato treatment requires a multi-pronged approach. Pay careful attention to air circulation, as target spot of tomato thrives in humid conditions. Grow the plants in full sunlight. Be sure the plants arenâ€™t crowded and that each tomato has plenty of air circulation. Cage or stake tomato plants to keep the plants above the soil.",
